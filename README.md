# Drum Kit Project

This is a simple drum kit web application that allows you to play different drum sounds by clicking on buttons or using corresponding keyboard keys. Each button corresponds to a specific drum sound, and when clicked or pressed, it plays the associated sound.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on the drum buttons with your mouse or press the following keyboard keys:
   - Press 'w' for crash sound
   - Press 'a' for tom-1 sound
   - Press 's' for snare sound
   - Press 'd' for tom-1 sound
   - Press 'j' for tom-2 sound
   - Press 'k' for tom-3 sound
   - Press 'l' for tom-1 sound

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the web page.
- CSS: Defines the visual styles of the buttons and the page layout.
- JavaScript: Handles the logic for playing the drum sounds and responding to user clicks or key presses.

## Folder Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles for the page elements.
- `sound/`: This folder contains the sound files used for the drum sounds.
- `images/`: This folder contains the images used as backgrounds for the drum buttons.
